** org-starter 0.2.8 (2020-03-21)
=org-starter-def-capture= now accepts non-string files in targets.

For example, the following definition caused an error in the previous versions, but it is considered valid if =my-org-file-symbol= refers to an existing Org file.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (org-starter-def-capture "x" "My capture template"
    entry
    (file my-org-file-symbol)
    "* %?")
#+end_src
