** org-starter 0.2.9 (2020-11-12)
=org-starter-define-file= now accepts =:minor-modes= argument, which can be used to activate certain monor modes in only in specific files:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (org-starter-define-file "practice.org"
    :minor-modes
    '(org-recur-mode
      (org-bullets-mode 1)
      (org-edna-mode -1)))
#+end_src

In the example above, =org-recur-mode= and =org-bullets-mode= is turned on in =practice.org=, and =org-edna-mode= is turned off in the file.
** org-starter 0.2.8 (2020-03-21)
=org-starter-def-capture= now accepts non-string files in targets.

For example, the following definition caused an error in the previous versions, but it is considered valid if =my-org-file-symbol= refers to an existing Org file.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (org-starter-def-capture "x" "My capture template"
    entry
    (file my-org-file-symbol)
    "* %?")
#+end_src
