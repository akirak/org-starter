Org-starter is a framework for basic configuration of Emacs Org Mode. It
allows you to configure Org Mode easily even with many files and
directories.

The standard way to configure Org Mode is set a bunch of variables such
as =org-agenda-files= and =org-refile-targets=. This makes it hard to
add/delete files to/from the configuration. Org-starter lets you
configure Org Mode in a file-centric and incremental manner, which
scales well especially if you have many Org files and sometimes have to
tweak the file list.

In other words, org-starter allows you to configure Org Mode in a manner
similar to use-package. The following is an example file configuration
with org-starter:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (org-starter-define-file "subjects.org"
      :agenda t
      :refile '(:maxlevel . 9))
#+END_SRC

** Prerequisites
- Emacs 25.1
- =dash= and =dash-functional=
- =swiper= if you use =org-starter-swiper=.

** Installation
Install =org-starter= package from MELPA.

If you use =org-starter-swiper=, install =org-starter-swiper= as well.

Note: =counsel-org-starter= and =helm-org-starter= in this repository are not
available on MELPA yet. Install them individually after installing
=org-starter= if you need them.
** Configuration
*** Load path for org files
You can set up a "load path" for Org files. This path is later used to
find an Org file with a specific file name. To set the load path,
customize =org-starter-path=.

You can also add directories to the load path by calling
=org-starter-define-directory= with =:add-to-path= option.
*** External configuration files
An obvious way to configure Org files using org-starter is to put the configuration in your Emacs initialization file, i.e. =~/.emacs.d/init.el=.  Org-starter also allows you to put it in an external configuration file residing in the same directory as your Org files. This is useful if have some host-local configuration and don't want to put it in your =init.el=. Org-starter is about Org files, so it makes sense to configure the package in alongside the files.

To use this feature, set =org-starter-load-config-files= custom variable to t.
Now you can put your configuration in =~/org/.org-config.el= if =~/org/= is included in =org-starter-path=:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; ~/.emacs.d/init.el: Configure org-starter
  (use-package org-starter
    :custom
    ;; Enable external configuration files loaded from org-starter-path
    (org-starter-load-config-files t))

  ;; Your custom-file: Set org-starter-path
  (custom-set-variables
   ...
   '(org-starter-path (quote ("~/org/")))
   ...
   )

  ;; Now you can put your configuration in ~/org/.org-config.el
  (org-starter-def "cpb.org")
#+end_src

You can put the configuration in any directories in =org-starter-path=. It is possible for you to put the configuration in a different directory
**** org-starter-swiper-config-files
=org-starter-swiper-config-files= command available from =org-starter-swiper=, which is a separate package, lets you run [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][swiper]] through your configuration files. It is handy for finding a particular location in your configuration. It may be a good idea to bind a key to the command:
*** Extras
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'org-starter-extra-alternative-find-file-map
             '(";" org-starter-swiper-config-files "config")
             t)
#+end_src

=org-starter-extra-alternative-find-file-map= is a list of commands available when you run =org-starter-alternative-find-file-by-key= command:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(define-key (kbd "C-c j") #'org-starter-alternative-find-file-by-key)
#+end_src

The following =org-capture= template lets you add a configuration quickly to one of your org-starter configuration files. =org-starter-find-config-file= lets you select an existing configuration file, and the entire target function navigates to the end of the selected file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(org-starter-def-capture "e" "Personal Emacs configuration"
  plain (function (lambda ()
                    (org-starter-find-config-file)
                    (goto-char (point-max))))
  "%i"
  :unnarrowed t)
#+end_src
*** Loading local variables in Org files without confirmation
You may have added local variables to your Org files. 
It is annoying to answer "yes" every time Emacs asks you if you are sure you want to load the variables. This can be skipped by enabling =org-starter-mode= and setting =org-starter-enable-local-variables= to =:all=. That is, =enable-local-variables= is temporarily overridden while a file registered by org-starter is loaded.

Since variables defined in your own files are trusted, this is generally considered safe. However, when you set this option to =:all=, please don't add a file that can be edited by someone else to =org-starter-known-files=, as local variables defined by others can bring a security risk.
** Usage
*** Configure directories
Use =org-starter-define-directory= function to define a directory that
contains Org files. You can add the directory to agenda files and/or
refile targets via its options.

You can also add it to the load path via =:add-to-path= option.

For details of options, run =C-h f org-starter-define-directory=.

*** Configure files
Use =org-starter-define-file= function to define an Org file. As with
directory definitions, you can add the file to agenda files and/or
refile targets.

You can also define Org files inside =org-starter-define-directory= form
as =:files= option.

For details, run =C-h f org-starter-define-file=.

**** Quickly access a particular file with a shortcut key
=org-starter-define-file= accepts optional =:key= property, whose value should be a key passed to =kbd= function. This property is used by =org-starter-find-file-by-key=, =org-starter-alternative-find-file-by-key=, and =org-starter-refile-by-key= commands, which enter a transient state to operate on a particular file quickly.

[[file:screenshots/org-starter-refile-by-key.png]]

You can also add custom commands to the transient keymaps by setting =org-starter-extra-find-file-map=, =org-starter-extra-alternative-find-file-map=, and =org-starter-extra-refile-map=, respectively.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-starter-extra-refile-map
        '(("/" org-refile "normal refile")))
#+end_src

For example, you can add a function that refiles entries into a date tree using my [[https://github.com/akirak/org-reverse-datetree][org-reverse-datetree]] package as in [[https://github.com/akirak/org-reverse-datetree#defining-a-refile-function][this example]].
*** =org-starter-def= macro
You can also use =org-starter-def= define either a file or a directory.
Depending on the type of the argument, it calls either
=org-starter-define-file= or =org-starter-define-directory=. It supports
the same functionality as the two functions, but it allows you to define
files and directories slightly more concisely.

It basically supports the same as options as
=org-starter-define-file=/=org-starter-define-directory=, but it doesn't
need quoting. For example, the following two directives are equivalent:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (org-starter-define-file "~/hello.org"
    :refile '(:maxlevel . 3))

    (org-starter-def "~/hello.org"
    :refile (:maxlevel . 3))
#+END_SRC

When you define a directory using =org-starter-def=, you can pass
multiple arguments as =:files= option:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (org-starter-def "~/my-directory"
      :files
      ("file1.org" :agenda t)
      ("file2.org" :agenda nil :required nil))
#+END_SRC

It also supports an additional option =:config=. Its argument is
evaluated after the other options are applied, as in =use-package=. This
is executed if and only if the file/directory exists. It can take
multiple arguments:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (org-starter-def "~/my-directory"
      :config
      (do-something)
      (do-another-thing))
#+END_SRC
*** Configure capture templates
Org-starter provides two ways to incrementally define org-capture templates:

- =:capture= property in =org-starter-define-file=, which lets you omit the file name of each template target. =(file FILENAME)= becomes =file= here.
- =org-starter-def-capture= macro, which lets you omit the directory of a file name in template target. The file is searched from the load path. If there is no file existing in the load path, the template is not added.

Templates added by org-starter are sorted alphabetically, so they are grouped by prefix letters even if they are defined in distributed locations.

Each template entry added by these functions is transformed by a function specified as the value of =org-starter-capture-template-map-function= custom variable. This can be used to apply rules to your capture templates.

There is also =org-starter-initial-capture-templates= custom variable, which is a recommended way to define template groups.
*** Extras
**** Locate a file
You can use =org-starter-locate-file= function to find an Org file
contained in one of the directories in =org-starter-path=:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (org-starter-locate-file "tasks.org")
#+END_EXAMPLE

To locate a file which is not in the path but already registered
(defined) as a known file, use the function with an extra third
argument. This function first tries to find a file in the list of known
files:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (org-starter-locate-file "file-not-in-path.org" nil t)
#+END_SRC

**** Load all known files
It is sometimes convenient to load a specific set of Org files into
Emacs as buffers. For example, you can search headings in the live Org
buffers using =counsel-org-goto-all=.

- To load all files registered by =org-starter-define-file= into Emacs,
  use =org-starter-load-all-known-files= command.
- To load all files in =org-starter-path= into Emacs, use
  =org-starter-load-all-files-in-path= command.
**** Jump to a file
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED_TIME: [2019-06-22 Sat 09:29]
:END:
If you set =:key= of a file in =org-starter-define-file=, you can jump to the file quickly with =org-starter-find-file-by-key= command.

You can also define extra bindings for the commands by adding entries to =org-starter-extra-find-file-map=:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Add a binding to jump to your Emacs init file
(setq org-starter-extra-find-map
      '(("e" (lambda () (interactive) (find-file "~/.emacs.d/init.el")) "init.el")))
#+end_src
**** Jump to a file (alternative mode)
This package also provides =org-starter-alternative-find-file-by-key=, which provides an alternative mode for jumping to a file. Like =org-starter-define-file=, it displays options based on =:key= property of your files, but it uses a different function, which is configured as
=org-starter-alternative-find-function=, for visiting a selected file. For example, you can use [[https://github.com/alphapapa/helm-org-rifle][helm-org-rifle-files]] for performing a search in the selected file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-starter-alternative-find-function 'helm-org-rifle-files)
#+end_src
**** Refile an entry to a file
When you are visiting a file in Org mode, you can use =org-starter-refile-by-key= to refile the current entry to a particular file. The refile level as set in =:refile= option is used for producing candidates.

Like the previous commands, you can add extra bindings to the command through =org-starter-extra-refile-map=. If you use [[https://github.com/akirak/org-reverse-datetree][org-reverse-datetree]], it is a good idea to define a custom refile function for your datetree file and add it to the map. =org-starter-extras.el= in this repository provides a shortcut for defining such a function concisely:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Define org-starter-refile-cpb-datetree function
(org-starter-extras-def-reverse-datetree-refile "cpb.org"
  '("CREATED_TIME" "CLOSED"))

(add-to-list 'org-starter-extra-refile-map
             '("p" org-starter-refile-cpb-datetree "cpb"))
#+end_src
*** org-starter-utils library
=org-starter-utils.el= is a collection of utilities related to Org mode.
It is part of =org-starter= package on MELPA and shipped with it, but it does not depend on =org-starter.el=,
so you can use it without loading =org-starter.el=.
Utilities in the library are designed to be useful with/without org-starter.
**** Avy and Org
The library provides some [[https://github.com/abo-abo/avy][avy]] interfaces to the features of Org mode.
You need to install avy to use these functions.

- =org-starter-utils-avy-id= is a function which returns =ID= property of an entry selected with avy.
  If the property is not set on the entry, it generates a new one.
- Similarly, =org-starter-utils-avy-custom-id= is a function which returns =CUSTOM_ID= property of an entry selected with avy.
  If the property is not set on the entry, it generates a new one.
- =org-starter-utils-avy-store-link-to-heading= stores a link to an entry selected with avy.
*** Helm interface to visit an Org file
A separate package =helm-org-starter.el= provides a Helm command named
=helm-org-starter= which you can use to select an Org file in various
categories or create a new one in a known directory.

*** Counsel interface
=counsel-org-starter.el= provides the following commands:

- =counsel-org-starter-known-file=, which lets you choose a known file.
- =counsel-org-starter=, which lets you choose a known file or a file in
  =org-agenda-files=.
